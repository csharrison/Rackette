Lazy Rackette
========
A lazy language written in OCaml


Instructions:
=====================
To run the REPL, run "ocaml lazy.ml" (in the lazy directory).

To evaluate a file, run "ocaml read_file <filepath>" which will create the top level bindings for your program and let you use them in a REPL.

Enjoy!

Spec (in progress)
==================


Other Notes
========================================================================
To use the eager language Lazy Rackette was based on (Rackette),
run "ocaml repl.ml" in the eager directory.

This language is a bit more sparse than Lazy Rackette, and is substitution based rather than environment based.
